Youth with borderline personality disorder have a long-standing pattern of intense, turbulent relationships and are terrified to be alone. They often cycle between idealizing someone and then hating him or her. Their moods are often intense and erratic, and they frequently have outbursts of anger.  Because of their lack of identity, these youth frequently change their goals, plans, and opinions. Self-mutilation and suicidal behaviors are common in youth who have borderline personality disorder. Because of their age, it is much more common for youth in the juvenile justice system to display borderline personality &#8220;traits&#8221; rather than the full-blown disorder.</td>

<td width="420">A disorder of childhood that is characterized by a persistent pattern of conduct in which the basic rights of others and the rules of society are disrupted or violated.   Many youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system have been aggressive or deceitful, have violated rules, or destroyed someone&#8217;s property. Such behavior is often the reason they were arrested. However, just because a youth has been arrested does not automatically mean the youth has conduct disorder. Youth with conduct disorder show a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior that violates rules or the rights of others (e.g., aggression, theft, destruction of property).   These youth typically have little empathy for other people and may lack feelings of guilt or remorse. They are often hostile and aggressive, and tend to blame other people for things they have done.</td>

If the sweat glands are affected, excessive sweating is present and dehydration and shock can result. CF also commonly affects the digestive tract. The excessive mucous in the tract doesn`t allow the breakdown of foods leading to poorly digested and absorbed nutrients. Thus children with this type of CF can have difficulty gaining weight and can become malnourished. When the lungs are involved, thick mucous can fill the lungs causing coughing and risk of infections. Pneumonia is a common symptom. Medical interventions are available to treat CF, but it is seldom cured.</td>

The discrete trial method has four distinct parts (according to Anderson et al, 1996): (1) the trainer&#8217;s presentation, (2) the child&#8217;s response, (3) the consequence, (4) a short pause between the consequence and the next instruction (between interval trials). In general, DTT programs target skills that are broken down into finite, discrete tasks. The behavioral therapist typically uses repetition, feedback, and positive reinforcers to help the child master small tasks. Once mastered, basic skills are used as building blocks to develop more complex abilities. Behavioral excesses such as tantrumming, aggression, and repetitive behaviors, may also be addressed. Not all programs using DTT follow the same program sequences or curriculum.</td>

Family therapists emphasize communication skills, clarification of family roles, and boundaries and attempt to modify the family system to improve the behavior of the youth. Regardless of the treatment approach, mental health treatment of youth should always involve the youth&#8217;s family (which involves anyone the youth identify as their &#8220;family&#8221;).

<td width="420">Disabilities affecting the manner one takes in information, retains it, and expresses the knowledge and understanding they have. Learning disabilities is a general term for a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in acquistion and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning, or mathematical abilities. They are intrinsic to the individual, presumed to be due to central nervous system dysfunction, and may occur across the life span. Problems in self-regulatory behaviors, social perception, and social interaction may exist with learning disabilities but do not by themselves constitute a learning disability. Though learning disabilities may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions or with extrinsic influences, they are not the result of those conditions or influences (National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities, 1981, revised 1988). See &#8220;Learning Disabilities&#8211;Continued&#8221; for other frequent characteristics. Frequent characteristics of learning disabilities include, but are not limited to, a marked discrepancy between achievement and potential with uneven abilities within an individual, average to above average intellectual functioning, processing deficits (e.g., auditory and/or visual perceptual problems), and long/short term auditory and/or visual memory deficits.</td>

<td width="420">Mediation is a free dispute resolution process available to parents of children with disabilities. If you are in disagreement with the school district, you can ask for mediation. All schools have the forms for mediation. The process works like this. You request mediation by filling out the form and giving it to the school as well as sending it to the state mediation bureau. The state mediation bureau (affectionately called MNSEMS) will then assign a third party to act as a mediator and arrange a date and location for the meeting. At the meeting, the mediator&#8217;s role is to try and help the parties resolve the issue. The mediator is not a judge or arbitrator and cannot make any decision about the dispute. If the parties resolve their differences, a mediation agreement is written. If the differences involve IEP programming as is often the case, an IEP will need to be written or revised. The parties can have more than one mediation session. The school district must participate in at least one mediation. Parents are encouraged but are not required to participate in mediation. Mediation cannot be used to deny or delay a due process hearing or other rights. Mediation discussions are confidential. Mediation has been tried for several months in the Nordberg case. For more information about mediation, contact MNSEMS at 612-296-2633.</td>

There are four distinct behavior patterns that have been found in children with Regulatory disorders. They include the hypersensitive child who is fearful of sensory stimulation, the under-reactive child who is self-absorbed and often withdrawn, the child who seeks out sensory information and has poor control of their behavior, and the child who may display a combination of the above but does not fit directly into one of the categories exclusively.</td>

Initially the child loses purposeful hand use followed by the development of characteristic hand movements such as hand wringing. The child also presents with severe difficulties with talking and understanding language as well as poor fine &amp; gross motor coordination, and a slowing of head-size growth. Other problems can also include seizures and difficulty breathing while awake. Rett Syndrome occurs in various countries and its prevalence rate is 1:10,000 to 1:23,000 live female births. It is sometimes misdiagnosed as autism, cerebral palsy or non-specific developmental delay.</td>

Sensory Integration is used to describe certain processes that go on in our brain, allowing us to make sense of the information we get from our environment and act on it. The term refers to the process by which the brain interprets and organizes various sensory experiences including sight, sound, smell, touch, movement, body awareness, and the pull of gravity.  Sensory integration is a normal phenomenon of central nervous system functioning and provides a foundation for more complex learning and behavior. For some individuals sensory integration does not develop as efficiently as it should.

It has been commonplace in philosophy (see Davidson 1984; Dennett 1987) to see this ability as intrinsically dependent upon our linguistic abilities. After all, language provides us a representational medium for meaning and intentionality : thanks to language we are able to describe other people’s and our own actions in an intentional way as in : &#8220;Ralph believes that Mary intends him to persuade George that p&#8221;. According to this view, the intentionality of natural language, that is, its suitability for expressing meanings and thoughts, is the key for understanding the intentionality of our theory of mind.</td>

This is called hypertonicity &amp; hypotonicity respectively. Another type of tone is fluctuating tone. Flucuating tone is present when then muscle tone varies between high, normal, &amp; low. The last type of tone is normal tone. Disorders such as Cerebral Palsy affect the amount of tone found in one`s muscles. High tone, low tone, &amp; fluctuating tone make it very difficulty to move in a coordinated fashion.</td>

It is common for multiple factors to be involved in the development of a voice disorder. An example is a patient with Reinke&#8217;s edema, a term used to describe very swollen vocal cords. These patients almost always are heavy, long-term smokers, most of whom have gastroesophageal reflux as well. Another example of a voice issue is a patient with vocal nodules. This condition is always associated with signs of increased laryngeal muscle tension. Since voice disorders are often multifactorial, appropriate diagnosis and treatment in each case depends upon identification and correction of all of the underlying factors.</td>
