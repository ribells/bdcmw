<p>Occupational therapists provide services to infants, toddlers and children who have or who are at risk for developmental delays or 
disabilities. Occupational therapy is concerned with a child&#8217;s ability to participate in daily life activities or 
&#8220;occupations&#8221;. Occupational therapists use their unique expertise to help children with social-emotional, physical, cognitive, communication, and 
adaptive behavioral challenges and to help children to be prepared for and perform important learning and school-related activities and to 
fulfill their rule as students. Through an understanding of the impact of disability, illness, and impairment on a child&#8217;s 
development, plan, ability to learn new skills, and overall occupational performance, occupational therapists design interventions 
that promote healthy development, establish needed skills, and/or modify environments, all in support of participation in daily 
activities.</p>
