<p>A <strong><em>"Functional Developmental Assessment" (FDA)</em></strong> 
is a means of evaluating a persons developmental status relying on interviews of individuals close to the person being assess and time spent directly with that person engaged in functional activities with them. Topics and perspectives asked through this evaluation process relies on questions generated from divergent therapeutic points of view, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developmental histories</li>
<li>Medical histories and circumstances</li>
<li>Sensory profiles</li>
<li>Movement inventories</li>
<li>Communication inventories</li>
<li>Interest inventories (time distribution on favorite activities)</li>
<li>Functional Behavioral Assessments (FBA) such as “antecedents” and “consequences” surrounding behavior</li>
<li>Ecological evaluations (descriptions of all relevant environments)</li>
<li>Relationship “inventory” (i.e., who do they like? who do they work well with? Why?, etc.)</li>
<li>Responses to augmentative and alternative technologies (i.e., electronics; expressive arts; differing modalities of information, etc.)</li>
<li>Experimental analysis of behavioral styles and response to a range of interventions (i.e., how did they do with other therapies? How does the person perform when we present them with differing approaches and methods?)</li>
<li>Evaluation of attention span, focus and style to understand an individual person’s ways of paying attention across settings and situations</li>
<li>Responses to individual, small &amp; larger group instructional situations</li>
<li>Changes that occur seasonally or across years and settings</li>
</ul>
