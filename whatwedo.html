						<h2>ADA In-Home and Community Services: The "Mentor Model"</h2>
<h3>The ADA Therapeutic Approaches</h3>
<p>The therapeutic approaches that we use with the children and families that we work with are a blend of very conventional approaches – such as the use of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy – as well as unconventional approaches. This includes the fact that our work with your family will be in your home and community. Though we will occasional see some of our clients in our office in Fairfield, our focus is to involve our staff with your family "where the action is happening." In addition to ABA therapy, we also draw on methods from Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Family Systems Therapy and Positive Psychology. We emphasize promoting healthy relationships among family members and others, engaging in activities that are action oriented and meaningful to your child, and activities that help your child see a purpose to what we are asking them to do. We also provide direct instruction that will allow you and your child to better understand the "reasons why" we behave the way we behave.
<br/><br/>
The daily activities with both our clinician and Mentor personnel emphasize feedback to both you and your child in "real time" as we model appropriate interactions and behavior over the 15-to-30-hours per week that you and your child are with our staff. This type of  "Incidental Learning" – where we can catch you and your child in the act of real-time struggles and successes – is the basis of our approach. A typical day involves a high level of structured activities following consistent schedules and routines. Mentors and therapists both engage in therapy the entire time they are with your family, even when it just looks like they are following familiar routines. Our approaches will also routinely expect direct involvement from all family members so that our staff can give feedback to everyone involved. This allows for you and your child to generalize what is being learned with staff present, to when they are not in your home. For years Dr. Weiss would be asked the rhetorical question "could you just move in with us?" to address the issues within the family. Now, with the support of you and your insurance company, we are "moving in!"
<br/><br/>
Promoting your child’s tolerance for "demands" being placed on them: A "Pivotal Response"
<br/><br/>
Central to our approach is routinely imposing demands on your child with the expectation that they will cooperate with these demands. The large majority of children that we work with have a history of resisting adult directions. Indeed, for most of our clients, demands being placed on him or her are triggers for very difficult behavior. Many children diagnosed with Autism can be quite rigid in their thinking and behavior. Developing your child’s willingness and ability to cooperatively respond to an adult direction is a "Pivotal Response (see Pivotal Response Treatment, by Robert & Lynn Koegel, 2019). That means that if your child becomes skilled and willing to follow adult directions without conflict, this positive response opens the door for many many other skills and abilities to come forward. As this relates to children on the Autism Spectrum, becoming more flexible in response to others around them is pivotal to reducing their rigidity. Imagine how different your child’s life (and your family’s life) would change if your child was more cooperative. Cooperation is ‘pivotal’ to promoting less rigidity and more mature behavior. To that end, we don’t avoid demands. Rather, we seek them out. However, the demands are not arbitrary or capricious. The typical daily demands are those that you would expect from any child – regardless of the Autism diagnosis. This will include daily living skills, communicating appropriately, participating in social activities, joining into therapeutic activities, daily chores, homework and more.</p>
<h2>Staffing</h2> 

<p>We will have two types of service providers working with your child once approved for a 26-week period (renewals must occur every 6-months) by your insurance carrier:
